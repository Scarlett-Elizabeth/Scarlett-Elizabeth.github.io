      <h3>My Story</h3>
      <!-- <h4>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, non elit.</h4> -->
      <p>The cloth was clean, the service shone; there were three kinds of well-baked bread, two bottles of wine, two of excellent mead, and a large glass jug of kvas -- both the latter made in the monastery, and famous in the neigborhood. There was
        no vodka. Rakitin related afterwards that there were five dishes: fish-suop made of sterlets, served with little fish paties; then boiled fish served in a spesial way; then salmon cutlets, ice pudding and compote, and finally, blanc-mange.
        Rakitin found out about all these good things, for he could not resist peeping into the kitchen, where he already had a footing. He had a footting everywhere, and got informaiton about everything. He was of an uneasy and envious temper. He
        was well aware of his own considerable abilities, and nervously exaggerated them in his self-conceit. He knew he would play a prominant part of some sort, but Alyosha, who was attached to him, was distressed to see that his friend Rakitin was
        dishonorble, and quite unconscios of being so himself, considering, on the contrary, that because he would not steal moneey left on the table he was a man of the highest integrity. Neither Alyosha nor anyone else could have infleunced him in
        that.</p>

      <h3>Portfolio</h3>
      <h4><a href="https://infinite-taiga-46884.herokuapp.com">Newsletter-Signup</a></h4>
      <p>Website created using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, MailChimp API, and Node.JS packages: express, body-parser, & request. Hosted on Heroku.
      <br>Please, feel free to sign up with non-sense, I don't currently use the newsletter.</p>
      <h4><a href="file:///Users/Scarlett/Desktop/Websites/Landing-Site/index.html">First Cut</a></h4>
      <p>A simple app I created to help servers determine who gets to go home first. Currently on the app store.</p>
      <h4><a href="file:///Users/Scarlett/Desktop/Websites/Olivia-and-Michael/index.html">Wedding Website</a></h4>
      <p>Unfinished wedding website for my sister. Please check out the "games" tab where you'll find a love-calculator I built using JavaScript and JQuery. It's rigged so that the only way to get 100% is to type in the names of the bride and groom
        in either input.
        <br>Currently building a guestbook and RSVP page using MongoDB.</p>
