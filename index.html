      <h3>My Story</h3>
      <!-- <h4>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, non elit.</h4> -->
      <p> I learned to make my first website when I was eight years old. The internet was new to the public, cereal boxes were advertising websites with games and activities, and AOL was giving away a hundred free hours on CDs at the grocery store.
        My dad had given my sister and me a book about HTML and CSS and we couldn’t wait to start recreating what we saw inside. I got to work right away, making bright blue websites with flashing green text about my favorite books and music, and I
        kept track of how many visitors my page received with a tiny tracker on the the bottom; it was truly the best computer game ever! I remember the first time I got in trouble for sending out mass e-mails to people, trying to get them to look at
        my website. I thought the internet was going to revoke my privileges after being labeled a “spammer”.</p>
      <p>I continued to practice web design throughout middle school and high school. They were simple and without purpose, it was just something to do when I was bored and while I knew there were other languages and skills to learn, for some reason,
        it always felt beyond my comprehension. When I got to college, however, while pursuing nearly every degree imaginable, curiosity got the best of me and I started to spend a little bit of time researching what was next. I taught myself
        Javascript and JQuery through articles and online tutorials and started making much cooler websites with animations and buttons that did more than open a link, about nothing. I had started working full-time when I was a senior in high school
        and unfortunately, because it was necessary for me for that trend to continue in order to live, and because programming was, in my mind, a fun hobby/computer game instead of a potential career, my education in that field did not progress much
        further for a while.</p>
      <p>
        A little over a year ago, I started to actually get serious about programming and I became interested in learning how to make applications for phones. I was coming up with new ideas for apps everyday, something I learned practically everyone
        does and will tell you about all of their ideas as soon as you tell them you’ve learned the language. I wasn’t sure where to start but eventually I stumbled across a website offering online courses that could teach anyone how to make any app
        they could dream of. I was weary of the apparent simplicity, aware of course that the internet is full of scams (I had downloaded “Happy 99” as a child so I knew what could happen to your computer if you weren’t careful) but this seemed like
        a legitimate website and if I never made it past the first section, I wouldn’t be out very much. Within the first few hours of the course, however, I was hooked. Swift had reignited my passion for learning how to code. I have since made at
        least 50 apps (most of them about nothing, of course) two of which are on the app store now. I’ve learned many other languages and programming skills as well. I am currently working on a website for my sister’s upcoming wedding and completing
        the iPhone apps for all of the ideas that I’m most excited about. Most recently, I have turned my attention to understanding and working with databases. I built a guestbook for my sister and her fiancé where friends and family can leave
        messages for the bride and groom and am now building a section so that guests can RSVP online. </p>
      <p>I try to learn something new every day and I’m excited to continue my education in this field. I have a lengthy background in customer service, I take direction well and I work efficiently by myself or with a team. In my free time I also
        enjoy photography, cooking, writing, and live music.</p>
